Hello there! Thanks for downloading this project. 
I hope you find it useful.

You can replace any model with the whale mode, the only thing you need to keep in mind is that your model uses the canvas material the whale has.

If you find some use for this project I would love to know, also if you like i can reference it at my site.
Also since this is a free project please consider a donating.
